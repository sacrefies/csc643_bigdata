To find the coefficients for a simple multiple regression 
equation predicting the income of a household in the given region
based on knowledge of the age of head of household, number of occupants,
and rent/own status. 

STEPS:

1. Create an array of Income values (Y)
2. Create a 2D array (X) with 4 columns - Column 1 = 1s in all rows,
Column 2 = the age of head of households, Column 3 = The number of household
occupants, Column 4 = 1 if home is owned, 0 if rented

To find the matrix of coefficients (Using the Java Matrix Class: http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/doc/)

b = (X^tX)^-1X^tY

Return the coefficients for each region.
